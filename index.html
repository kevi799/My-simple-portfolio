            <p>
                Hi, I'm Kevin Mulinge, a passionate software developer currently learning how to code at Moringa School. 
                My journey into the world of technology has been exciting and rewarding as I dive deep into 
                different programming languages and development tools. I'm enthusiastic about building efficient, 
                user-friendly applications and honing my problem-solving skills. 
            </p>
            <p>
                At Moringa School, I'm learning to think like a developer by working on various real-world projects 
                and collaborating with peers. The school has helped me develop a solid foundation in web development, 
                object-oriented programming, and algorithmic thinking. I am eager to continue learning, growing, 
                and contributing to the tech community.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to become a full-stack developer, mastering both front-end and back-end development to create 
                dynamic and responsive web applications. Iâ€™m always up for a challenge, and I look forward to solving 
                complex problems through code.
            </p>
            <p>I am experinced in these languages</p>
